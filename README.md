# DES in Python

This repository is dedicated to explore the implementation of Discrete Event Simulation using Python (for now it is only SimPy)
We will try to exercise this particular tool through study cases

For starters, I would like to recommend you to check out my Coffee and Pizza Eatery case example that will provide you primal knowledge about doing simulation in Python, and about simulation itself, especially the discrete-event one.
