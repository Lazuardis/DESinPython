        "The optimal solution identified here reflects an average waiting time of 54.8 minutes for a customer throughout the entire process within the eatery. When comparing this result to the earlier line graph, it appears notably higher, especially considering some solutions showed a performance of less than 20 minutes. This discrepancy underscores the impact of integrating constraints, where intuitively, excessively low performance (less than 20 minutes) may be attributed to employing too much staff, resulting in utilization performance below the minimum expected threshold, thus making it infeasible.\n",

Rather than illustrating the fluctuating performance across all possible solutions through heuristic steps, we now showcase the 'best solution' after the n-th possible solution on the x-axis. This adjustment provides a clearer representation of the performance trend, focusing on the optimal solutions rather than the individual performances of each possible solution, as done earlier."
